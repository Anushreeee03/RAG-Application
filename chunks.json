At that time, the Office of Price Administration (OPA) oversaw the collection of corporate financial data. After the war, the responsibility for the QFR shifted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which jointly managed the survey for decades. In 1971, the FTC became the sole administrator of the QFR. In 1982, the QFR was transferred to the U.S. Census Bureau, where it remains today as a vital tool for monitoring corporate economic activity.",

Originally focused primarily on manufacturing firms, the QFR expanded its industry scope and modernized its classification systems. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the QFR transitioned from using the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), updating historical data to reflect this change. This modernization ensured that industries were more accurately defined according to contemporary economic activities. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the QFR extended its coverage to include selected service industries such as information services and certain professional and technical services, excluding legal services. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, retail trade statistics were also integrated alongside manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, and selected services, providing a broader, more comprehensive view of corporate performance across major sectors.",

This indicates efficient deployment of surplus funds in profitable avenues while ensuring risk remains within acceptable levels. Interest earned on balances with the Reserve Bank of India and other banks also grew to ₹767.40 crore in Q1 FY2025-26, up from ₹706.12 crore in the previous quarter and significantly higher than ₹443.00 crore for the same period last year, reflecting better cash management and returns on surplus liquidity. Other interest income rose to ₹923.75 crore for the quarter, up from ₹693.17 crore in March 2025 and ₹287.66 crore in Q1 FY2024-25, signifying an increase in miscellaneous interest revenue streams such as fees linked to loan products.",

This non-interest income includes earnings from commissions, foreign exchange transactions, treasury operations, and other fee-based services, underscoring the bank’s focus on diversifying its income sources beyond traditional lending activities. Consequently, the total income combining interest income and other income stood at an impressive ₹51,451.81 crore for Q1 FY2025-26, which marks a clear increase compared to ₹49,690.87 crore for the preceding quarter and ₹45,997.70 crore for the comparable quarter in the prior financial year.",

This marks an increase compared to ₹10,788.76 crore spent during Q4 FY2024-25 and ₹10,529.99 crore during Q1 FY2024-25.
