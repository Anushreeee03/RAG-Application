This growth underlines the bank’s steady expansion in its core lending business and healthy credit offtake. Breaking down the interest earned, the bank generated ₹32,542.92 crore purely from interest income during Q1 FY2025-26. While this figure is slightly lower than the ₹32,821.33 crore earned in the previous quarter, it reflects an increase compared to ₹30,108.54 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, demonstrating the bank’s ability to sustain income from its interest-bearing assets despite a dynamic rate environment.

Income from investments for the current quarter came in at ₹8,712.84 crore, which is higher than both ₹8,210.18 crore recorded in March 2025 and ₹8,156.58 crore in June 2024. This indicates efficient deployment of surplus funds in profitable avenues while ensuring risk remains within acceptable levels. Interest earned on balances with the Reserve Bank of India and other banks also grew to ₹767.40 crore in Q1 FY2025-26, up from ₹706.12 crore in the previous quarter and significantly higher than ₹443.00 crore for the same period last year, reflecting better cash management and returns on surplus liquidity.
