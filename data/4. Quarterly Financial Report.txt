About the Quarterly Financial Report

The Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) is an essential source of timely information on the financial condition of U.S. corporations, providing aggregated statistics on their results and positions every three months. Since its inception in 1947, the QFR has been a trusted barometer for analysts, policymakers, and the business community, helping them assess corporate performance and broader economic trends.

Purpose and Origins:
The QFR was established in response to the need for reliable financial data during World War II, when the U.S. government required precise economic intelligence to manage price controls and industrial production. At that time, the Office of Price Administration (OPA) oversaw the collection of corporate financial data. After the war, the responsibility for the QFR shifted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which jointly managed the survey for decades. In 1971, the FTC became the sole administrator of the QFR. In 1982, the QFR was transferred to the U.S. Census Bureau, where it remains today as a vital tool for monitoring corporate economic activity.

Evolution of Coverage:
Over the decades, the QFR has adapted to the evolving structure of the U.S. economy. Originally focused primarily on manufacturing firms, the QFR expanded its industry scope and modernized its classification systems. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the QFR transitioned from using the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), updating historical data to reflect this change. This modernization ensured that industries were more accurately defined according to contemporary economic activities. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the QFR extended its coverage to include selected service industries such as information services and certain professional and technical services, excluding legal services. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, retail trade statistics were also integrated alongside manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, and selected services, providing a broader, more comprehensive view of corporate performance across major sectors.

Current Scope:
Today, the QFR reports on corporations operating in key NAICS sectors: Mining (codes 211–213); Manufacturing (311–316, 321–327, 331–337, 339); Wholesale Trade (423–425); Retail Trade (441, 444–445, 449, 455–459); and Selected Service Industries (512–513, 516–519, 541 except 5411 Legal Services). To ensure meaningful estimates, corporations must meet minimum size thresholds to be included. For manufacturing firms, domestic assets must be at least \$5 million, while corporations in mining, wholesale trade, retail trade, and selected service industries must have domestic assets of \$50 million or more.

Frequency and Process:
The QFR is conducted every quarter, aligning with the fiscal quarters of participating corporations. Companies report for each fiscal quarter and are included in the published calendar quarter estimates according to when their books are closed. Data for the first, second, and third calendar quarters are released about 75 days after the quarter ends, while the fourth-quarter data is released about 90 days after year-end to accommodate annual reporting requirements and capture holiday sales impacts.

Corporations receive survey forms according to their industry and size. Large companies in sectors like manufacturing, mining, wholesale and retail trade, and information services receive a long form to capture more detailed financial data. Small and mid-sized manufacturing corporations complete a shorter version of the survey. The QFR’s sample frame is updated each year using federal income tax records, ensuring that the survey reflects the current corporate landscape. Large corporations with assets exceeding \$250 million are typically included in the QFR sample with certainty and continue reporting each quarter until they no longer meet scope requirements. Other corporations are selected through stratified random sampling by industry and asset size, with one-eighth of the panel replaced each quarter. Once selected, companies report for eight consecutive quarters.

Products and Data Availability:
Each quarterly data release is accompanied by a press release that summarizes the key findings and highlights trends in corporate finance. Reports are issued in both PDF and Excel formats and are readily accessible on the QFR website under Historical Data. These publications offer detailed information on manufacturing, mining, wholesale and retail trade, and selected service industries, providing researchers and policymakers with critical insights into the performance of these sectors. Historical data are maintained online in Excel format, ensuring that long-term trends can be analyzed and compared over time.

Uses of the Data:
QFR statistics serve as a primary source for current estimates of corporate profits in the Nation’s Gross Domestic Income Accounts. Beyond this core purpose, QFR data are widely used by various government agencies, domestic and international businesses, financial analysts, researchers, trade associations, and banks. Applications include analyzing corporate debt structures, liquidity, and profitability; estimating corporate tax liabilities; shaping economic policy and legislation; making investment decisions; and studying economic cycles and trends.

Legal Authority and Confidentiality:
The collection of the QFR is authorized under Title 13 of the United States Code, Section 91, which mandates quarterly collection and publication of corporate financial statistics. To safeguard the confidentiality of respondents, Section 9 of Title 13 prohibits the Census Bureau from disclosing any information that could identify a company. Additionally, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires that all data transmission systems are screened for cybersecurity threats to protect respondents’ information.
