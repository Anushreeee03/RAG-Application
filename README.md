# 📊 FinBot: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Financial Reports

FinBot is a GenAI-powered assistant built as part of a NexTurn internship project. It answers natural language queries about quarterly financial reports from real-world companies such as Infosys, TCS, Reliance, and Netflix.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To design and deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that:

- Ingests multi-format financial documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON)
- Extracts and embeds text data with metadata
- Answers questions using vector similarity and LLM (LLaMA3 via GROQ)
- Returns accurate, short financial responses with source references
- Includes an evaluation mode for accuracy tracking

## 💡 Prompt Engineering

### Answer Prompt

```
ONLY return short numeric/currency answer.

Context:
{top_k_chunks}

Q: {user_question}
A:
```

### Insight Mode Prompt

```
Give a 1-line summary and follow-up question for: {answer}
```

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

Evaluation is run using:

```bash
python evaluate_rag.py
```

### Metrics Used:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Avg Latency
* Fuzzy Match (>= 0.85 = correct)

### Example Result

```json
{
  "accuracy": 0.9,
  "precision": 1.0,
  "recall": 0.9,
  "f1": 0.947,
  "avg_latency_sec": 0.985
}
```

## 🎯 Features

* Parses PDFs, CSVs, TXTs, and JSONs into paragraph chunks
* Performs semantic search using FAISS
* Uses LLaMA3 (via GROQ) for short, numeric financial responses
* Shows relevant source documents for transparency
* Includes “Insight Mode” for contextual suggestions
* Evaluation Dashboard built into the UI

---

## ✅ How to Run

1. Place documents in the `data/` folder
2. Run `build_index.py` to chunk, embed, and index documents
3. Start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📈 Sample Questions

* What was Infosys’s net income in Q1?
* What was TCS’s revenue in Q4 FY22?
* What was Reliance’s total revenue?
* What was the EPS for Data Company Ltd?
* What was the headcount of TCS?

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Cross-encoder re-ranking
* Real-time document upload
* Better company/quarter metadata extraction
* Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + FAISS)
* Feedback-based improvement
